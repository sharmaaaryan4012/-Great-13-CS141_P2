Great 13 - peg game
This is a one player game, where the goal is to clear the peg board. Pegs are only removed if they are "hopped" by another peg on the board. The example on the right illustrates this in action. The board is a diamond shape, with pegs rep- resented by the symbol #. Empty spaces are indicated by "." The positions on the board are labelled on the right.
